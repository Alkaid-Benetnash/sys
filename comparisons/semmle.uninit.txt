1. FALSE: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/docshell/base/nsDocShell.cpp#3787 (bucketId). If you look at outer if, one if the if-then-else that inits bucketId will definitly match.

2. FALSE: https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/base/Document.cpp#1776 (notAfter). Very clearly init on line 1752 and before on 1745.
